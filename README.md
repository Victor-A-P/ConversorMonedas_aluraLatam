# ConversorMonedas_aluraLatam

```
This is a repository where I am uploading
the project after finishing the first part of my formation.

In this case I decided to change a little bit the project so
instead of 6 option you can select first wich kind o money you have and
then can select the tipe of conversi√≥n you want to make.

The first step would be adding the key of your API
And after making sure that everything in your IDE its ok
Then after runnning the programm a screen like the one below should appear
Where you can select tipe of currency you have

```
In that screen you should choose one of the options mentioned
After that it will appear another promt where you should introduce
your amount of money you want to exchance. Then a similar promt
will appear where you can select the other tipe of currency you want to convert

*Any other number will exit the operation
```

```
Then the result of the convertion will be shown and you can continue making other
convertions until you choose not to do so.

Then the final promt will apear giving you a summary of the convertions that you made

At the same time a file .json will be created with this info
